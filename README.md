# neovim config

i try to use neovim everywhere, and where i do, i also use this config.  
who needs mice anyways...

this config is NvChad based. 
## requirements

- NeoVim  0.10.0 (or greater)
    - will also work with some older versions of nvim, but some features may break.
    
- many **language servers** need npm to be installed, and grammarly needs cargo. 
    - npm
    - cargo

## setup 
clone this repo into `~/.config/nvim/`.  
wait for the syncing to finish. if there are issues, check whether you fulfill the requirements, close and reopen and press `space u a` to update the plugins. quit that window and from withing nvim press `space u m` to install language servers, formatters and linters.
both of these key combinations are used for updating too, so rerun them as you like, especially if there are issues.
